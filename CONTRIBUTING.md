We'll be glad to accept patches and contributions to the project. There are
just few guidelines we ask to follow.

Contribution license Agreement
==============================

If you want/plan to contribute, we ask you to sign a
[CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/) (Contribution License Agreement).
A friendly bot will remind you about it when you submit a pull-request.

This project has adopted the
[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct).
For more information see the
[Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq)
or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with
any additional questions or comments.

Submitting a contribution
=========================

It's generally best to start by
[opening a new issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue)
describing the work you intend to submit. Even for minor tasks, it's helpful
to know what contributors are working on. Please mention in the initial issue
that you are planning to work on it, so that it can be assigned to you.

Follow the usual GitHub flow process of
[forking the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo),
and setup a new branch to work in. Each group of changes should be done in
separate branches, in order to ensure that a pull request only
includes the changes related to one issue.

Any significant change should almost always be accompanied by tests. Look at
the existing tests to see the testing approach and style used.

## Code style

Some quick notes about the project code style:

1. Code blocks indentation with 4 spaces. The tab char should be avoided.
2. Text files use Unix end of line format (LF).
